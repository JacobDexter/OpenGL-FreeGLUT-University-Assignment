# OpenGL-FreeGLUT-University-Assignment
## The Game
The game is a showcase of some of the rendering capabilities of OpenGL and FreeGLUT. The scene consists of many stars around a large asteroid. The stars rotation can be sped up and slowed with user input and the camera can be moved around the asteroid to see each edge of it. A timer in the top left of the screen can be used to see how long the game has been running for.
## Controls
* S, W – +/- Z axis camera movement
* D, A – +/- X axis camera movement
* Q – Slow down star rotation
* E – Speed up star rotation
